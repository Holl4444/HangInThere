## Overview

Based on the final Capstone project in Scrimba's Learn React Course.
The aim is to solve the word puzzle and choose a cat, before the only pet choice remaining is a spider (8 moves).
With unlimited resources I'd like to have the cats hanging as in the notorious posters and falling when you guess incorrectly in case anyone was wondering about the name!

## The Process


## Built With

JS - JSX - HTML - CSS - REACT - VITE

## Key Skills Employed

- Iteratively planning before coding.
- Prop Drilling and controlling state.
- Understanding file structure.
- It was fascinating to learn a little more about accessibility (aria-labels, aria-live, and "sr-only" sections). I'll have to look more into this, as well as learning about contrasting colours.

## Continued Development

- Linking to an API to pull word lists in.
- Counter to track turns left before spider.
- Making the app more engaging: adding a transition to make losing a cat more obvious, enlarging and centering the spider on loss and adding sounds.
- If the app gets any larger, to try createContext.
- Improved styling for different devices. 
- To organise the folder structure.
